#   Downloads a CUDA variant of 'torch' from the correct index, based on CUDA major version.
#
#   This exists to avoid using 'pip --extra-index-url', which has these undesirable properties:
#
#     - allows for CPU-only 'torch' to be downloaded from pypi.org
#     - allows for other non-torch packages like 'numpy' to be downloaded from the PyTorch indices
#     - increases solve complexity for 'pip'

# Ensure CUDA-enabled 'torch' packages are always used.
#
# Downloading + passing the downloaded file as a requirement forces the use of this
# package and ensures 'pip' considers all of its requirements.
#
# Not appending this to PIP_CONSTRAINT, because we don't want the torch '--extra-index-url'
# to leak outside of this script into other 'pip {download,install}'' calls.
