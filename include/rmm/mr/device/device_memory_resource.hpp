 * @brief Base class for all libcudf device memory allocation.

 * This class serves as the interface that all custom device memory
 * implementations must satisfy.
 *
 * There are two private, pure virtual functions that all derived classes must
 *implement: `do_allocate` and `do_deallocate`. Optionally, derived classes may
 *also override `is_equal`. By default, `is_equal` simply performs an identity
 *comparison.
 *
 * The public, non-virtual functions `allocate`, `deallocate`, and `is_equal`
 * simply call the private virtual functions. The reason for this is to allow
 * implementing shared, default behavior in the base class. For example, the
 * base class' `allocate` function may log every allocation, no matter what
 * derived class implementation is used.
