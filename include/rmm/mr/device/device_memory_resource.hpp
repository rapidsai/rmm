/**
 * @brief Base class for all libcudf device memory allocation.
 *
 * This class serves as the interface that all custom device memory
 * implementations must satisfy.
 *
 * There are two private, pure virtual functions that all derived classes must implement:
 *`do_allocate` and `do_deallocate`. Optionally, derived classes may also override `is_equal`. By
 * default, `is_equal` simply performs an identity comparison.
 *
 * The public, non-virtual functions `allocate`, `deallocate`, and `is_equal` simply call the
 * private virtual functions. The reason for this is to allow implementing shared, default behavior
 * in the base class. For example, the base class' `allocate` function may log every allocation, no
 * matter what derived class implementation is used.
 *
 * The `allocate` and `deallocate` APIs and implementations provide stream-ordered memory
 * allocation. This allows optimizations such as re-using memory deallocated on the same stream
 * without the overhead of stream synchronization.
 *
 * A call to `allocate(bytes, stream_a)` (on any derived class) returns a pointer that is valid to
 * use on `stream_a`. Using the memory on a different stream (say `stream_b`) is Undefined Behavior
 * unless the two streams are first synchronized, for example by using
 * `cudaStreamSynchronize(stream_a)` or by recording a CUDA event on `stream_a` and then
 * calling `cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream_b, event)`.
 *
 * The stream specified to deallocate() should be a stream on which it is valid to use the
 * deallocated memory immediately for another allocation. Typically this is the stream on which the
 * allocation was *last* used before the call to deallocate(). The passed stream may be used
 * internally by a device_memory_resource for managing available memory with minimal
 * synchronization, and it may also be synchronized at a later time, for example using a call to
 * `cudaStreamSynchronize()`.
 *
 * For this reason, it is Undefined Behavior to destroy a CUDA stream that is passed to
 * deallocate(). If the stream on which the allocation was last used has been destroyed before
 * calling deallocate() or it is known that it will be destroyed, it is likely better to synchronize
 * the stream (before destroying it) and then pass a different stream to deallocate() (e.g. the
 * default stream).
 *
 * A device_memory_resource should only be used when the active CUDA device is the same device
 * that was active when the device_memory_resource was created. Otherwise behavior is undefined.
 *
 * Creating a device_memory_resource for each device requires care to set the current device
 * before creating each resource, and to maintain the lifetime of the resources as long as they
 * are set as per-device resources. Here is an example loop that creates `unique_ptr`s to
 * pool_memory_resource objects for each device and sets them as the per-device resource for that
 * device.
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * using pool_mr = rmm::mr::pool_memory_resource<rmm::mr::cuda_memory_resource>;
 * std::vector<unique_ptr<pool_mr>> per_device_pools;
 * for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
 *   cudaSetDevice(i);
 *   // Note: for brevity, omitting creation of upstream and computing initial_size
 *   per_device_pools.push_back(std::make_unique<pool_mr>(upstream, initial_size));
 *   set_per_device_resource(cuda_device_id{i}, &per_device_pools.back());
 * }
 * @endcode
