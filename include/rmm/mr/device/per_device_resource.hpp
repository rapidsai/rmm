/**
 * @file per_device_resource.hpp
 * @brief Management of per-device `device_memory_resource`s
 *
 * One might wish to construct a `device_memory_resource` and use it for (de)allocation
 * without explicit dependency injection, i.e., passing a reference to that object to all places it
 * is to be used. Instead, one might want to set their resource as a "default" and have it be used
 * in all places where another resource has not been explicitly specified. In applications with
 * multiple GPUs in the same process, it may also be necessary to maintain independent default
 * resources for each device. To this end, the `set_per_device_resource` and
 * `get_per_device_resource` functions enable mapping a CUDA device id to a `device_memory_resource`
 * pointer.
 *
 * For example, given a pointer, `mr`, to a `device_memory_resource` object, calling
 * `set_per_device_resource(cuda_device_id{0}, mr)` will establish a mapping between CUDA device 0
 * and `mr` such that all future calls to `get_per_device_resource(cuda_device_id{0})` will return
 * the same pointer, `mr`. In this way, all places that use the resource returned from
 * `get_per_device_resource` for (de)allocation will use the user provided resource, `mr`.
 *
 * @note `device_memory_resource`s make CUDA API calls without setting the current CUDA device.
 * Therefore a memory resource should only be used with the current CUDA device set to the device
 * that was active when the memory resource was created. Calling `set_per_device_resource(id, mr)`
 * is only valid if `id` refers to the CUDA device that was active when `mr` was created.
 *
 * If no resource was explicitly set for a given device specified by `id`, then
 * `get_per_device_resource(id)` will return a pointer to a `cuda_memory_resource`.
 *
 * To fetch and modify the resource for the current CUDA device, `get_current_device_resource()` and
 * `set_current_device_resource()` will automatically use the current CUDA device id from
 * `cudaGetDevice()`.
 *
 * Creating a device_memory_resource for each device requires care to set the current device
 * before creating each resource, and to maintain the lifetime of the resources as long as they
 * are set as per-device resources. Here is an example loop that creates `unique_ptr`s to
 * pool_memory_resource objects for each device and sets them as the per-device resource for that
 * device.
 *
 * @code{c++}
 * std::vector<unique_ptr<pool_memory_resource>> per_device_pools;
 * for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
 *   cudaSetDevice(i);
 *   per_device_pools.push_back(std::make_unique<pool_memory_resource>());
 *   set_per_device_resource(cuda_device_id{i}, &per_device_pools.back());
 * }
 * @endcode
