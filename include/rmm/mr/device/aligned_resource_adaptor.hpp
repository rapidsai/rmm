 * @brief Resource that adapts `Upstream` memory resource to allocate memory in a specified
 * alignment size.
 *
 * An instance of this resource can be constructed with an existing, upstream resource in order
 * to satisfy allocation requests. This adaptor wraps allocations and deallocations from Upstream
 * using the given alignment size.
 *
 * By default, any address returned by one of the memory allocation routines from the CUDA driver or
 * runtime API is always aligned to at least 256 bytes. For some use cases, such as GPUDirect
 * Storage (GDS), allocations need to be aligned to a larger size (4 KiB for GDS) in order to avoid
 * additional copies to bounce buffers.
 *
 * Since a larger alignment size has some additional overhead, the user can specify a threshold
 * size. If an allocation's size falls below the threshold, it is aligned to the default size. Only
 * allocations with a size above the threshold are aligned to the custom alignment size.
 *
 * @tparam Upstream Type of the upstream resource used for allocation/deallocation.
